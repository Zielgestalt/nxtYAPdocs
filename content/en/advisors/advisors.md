During the [vault creation process](/vaults/create-vault) you have to select advisors.

## What are advisors?

The competitive advantage afforded by the Yieldster platform lies in its ability to empower users to create and deploy advisors. Advisors are algorithms that create financial action plans tailored for a vault to allocate funds in various DeFi protocols. Advisor developers provide the algorithms and propriety knowledge that makes a financial strategy successful.

## Available Advisors

Yieldster currently offers two types of Advisors: the Maximise APR and the Portfolio-Allocator. More advisors will be added to the list in the future. Vault admins can choose Maximise APR or Portfolio Allocator as advisors for their vaults. If they want to configure custom advisors, Yieldster allows them to [create their own advisors](/advisors/custom-advisors). Once the advisor has been selected, the admin must customize the settings.

## Create Custom Advisors

Yieldster offers a platform for advisor developers to create custom advisors.
