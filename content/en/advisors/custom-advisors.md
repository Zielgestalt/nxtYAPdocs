## Why a Custom Advisor?

The vault administrator can add custom parameters along with other mandatory fields that are solely relevant to their vault operations. The vault administrator can provide the custom parameter and its associated value as a key-value pair. You can utilize several custom parameters by clicking the "Add new field" button. These advisors can identify multiple vaults and provide varied advice.

## What is provided?

The Yieldster Advisor Development Kit provides a number of functions for creating advisors for user vaults and retrieving metadata from all vaults built on the Yieldster platform.

## Supported Programming Languages
