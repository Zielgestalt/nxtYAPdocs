#### Email

The advisor will be notified via email if an error occurs during advisor execution.

#### Endpoint

The endpoint specifies the URL where the advisor program is hosted. 

#### T (in minutes)

The minimum amount that must be present in a vault in order to carry out the execution.

#### Protocols

Select the protocols, from which the advisor will choose the protocol with the highest APR and invest the vault assets in that protocol.

#### Foreced Rebalance

If the vault administrator enables Forced rebalance, the advisor will execute even if the assets in the vault are less than the minimum transaction size, i.e. the Tmin value.
