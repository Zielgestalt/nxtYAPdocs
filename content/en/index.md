## Handbook Automation Platform

Welcome to Yieldster  Docs - documentation for the world’s most powerful Automation platform in the DEFI Space. 

This documentation contains resources to learn more about Yieldsters Automation platform,  and how to set up and manage vaults.

## About Yieldster

Yieldster’s vision is to become a recognized, blue-chip financial technology company that serves investors in the DeFi sector. It will provide a transparent, regulatory compliant, and highly secure platform for capital deployment. This technology will maximize risk-adjusted returns across leading DeFi protocols with a focus on maintaining principal and achieve returns by allocating capital to income streams.

## About the DeFi Automation Platform

We built our platform for strategy developers, fund managers, and investors to easily design, launch, and invest in DeFi products so that investors have an arbiter of trust to evaluate the best investment options.

To achieve this goal, the Yieldster platform provides reliable, automated infrastructure with timely data and powerful tools. It empowers institutional and retail investors to focus on developing successful capital deployment strategies rather than facing the burden of maintenance and upkeep.

Yieldster’s design simplifies the deployment of complex strategies to enable greater possibilities with predictable behavior. It consists of tools that allow anyone to create vaults, design or choose a strategy, apply a strategy to the vault, and decide who can deposit into the vault.
