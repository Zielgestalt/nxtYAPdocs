## What is a Yieldster Vault about?

Vaults hold a basket of assets or loans against which financial strategies can be applied. They utilize smart contracts, which removes the need for a third-party custodian. The vault also allows cross-chain self-custody of assets all of which can be managed through Yieldster. Vaults automate the management of assets, deposits, and withdrawals, as well as the calculation of fees. They grant permission for an automated advisor to deploy assets on its behalf, and the assets always remain under the vault's ownership and directly under the usersâ€™ control. ( see WP)

You can set up an Yieldster Vault in 4 easy steps within minutes and choose your own strategy. You can choose to do that as a private vault for e.g. your family or as a public vault. There are several protocols you can choose from.

## What is the difference between a public and a  private Vault?

Vaults can be both private and open to the public. Users who participate in the vault are issued tokens, representing their proportional share. To add a public vault to the platform, it must first be approved by the Yieldster DAO to ensure it meets the Yieldster standard.
